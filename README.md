# Ticket Management (Vue)

This repository contains a Vue 3 + TypeScript application scaffold. I added Vite, TypeScript, Tailwind and Pinia configuration so the project can run locally.

Quick start:

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

What I added:
- `package.json` with scripts and deps (you still need to run `npm install`)
- `tsconfig.json`, `vite.config.ts`, `index.html`
- `tailwind.config.cjs`, `postcss.config.cjs`
- moved source files into `src/` and converted zustand stores to Pinia
- `.gitignore`, ESLint config

If you want me to run `npm install` and validate the dev server, tell me and I'll run the commands for you.
